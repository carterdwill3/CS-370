# CS-370
Current/Emerging Trends in CS

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
I was given the entire code for this final project - everthing in the template on the main code was given, outside of the Q-learning code. The meat in the code was not to be changed, but the heart runs a functioning logic code to give the power of decision making to the player.


**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists use mathematical concepts to generate methods, build and solve hard problems, and it's important because the powers of a computer scientist is used in almost every field that uses computers, controller, or whatever social-networking device may be present.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I really try to take complex problems or projects, and break them down into smaller, more manageable segments of work (usually code). It just makes it easier to manage and easier to troubleshoot as you build on top of what already works.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
I think I need to look out more for safety and security in this line of work than I originally thought about when starting this journey in completing a CS degree. Getting into CS without focusing on cyber-securty, user safety almost becomes an afterthought, as it doesn't seem like something that should be a concern; this is #1. Writing ethical and unbias code while being clear on what my limitations may be is also very important. I believe I can figure out any problem if I'm given the time, but sometimes you just don't have the time and sometimes I find myself making it difficult in asking for help, but I will get better at recognizing my limits and learning from these situations.
